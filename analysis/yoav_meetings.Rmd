## Introduction

```{r}

###July 19, 2021
We talked further about the issue identified last week, is the large residual variation and relatively small amount explained by cell line, treatment, and replicate.  

One possibility is that the ANOVA model is incorrect in some way.  I investigated this possibility somewhat by asking whether cell cluster or cell line were correlated with early PCs (given that cell cluster explained much less expression variation than residuals).  Indeed I found that they are, but Yoav's next questions were: (1) what fraction of variation is explained by the first PCs, and (2) what is the correlation between these PCs and cluster, and (3) what is the correlation between early PCs and the residuals of the variance partition models?  These are the kinds of questions he turns to when trying to explain these sorts of mysteries, and I should be learning them like second nature.

The next thing to check is whether there are actually genes differentially expressed across treatment conditions, by cluster.  This can be done with DE software, or as simply as with a t-test using the expression values from one treatment and another, by cluster.  If there are no differentially expressed genes, then that's at least consistent.  But if there are DE genes then there's a problem with the ANOVA model.

Finally, he notes that we still have relatively low UMI/cell and so we'll really need the full data to make a full judgment here.

This is the `workflowr` project for initial analysis of low-pass sequencing from my organoid pilot project.  Three individuals were used to differentiate cerebral organoids in triplicate, which were then left as controls or stimulated before single-cell (10x) data were collected.  A total of 11 libraries were constructed, of which 9 are immediately relevant to this project.

To [start](precheck.html), I used one of the control libraries to check the quality of the data and its 
correspondence to previous datasets.

[Next](combine_experiments.html), I used SCTransform-ed versions of all datasets to create an integrated Seurat object for clustering and expression analysis.  In this document I also look for expression of a few stress-related genes and begin to use the `variancePartition` package to assess reproducibility and the factors contributing to gene expression variation in my dataset.  I also include suggestions from KB and YG after an initial discussion of these findings.

[To explore their suggestions further](variance-estimation.html), I looked at the effect or running the analysis on separated clusters and downsampling cell numbers.

Not all of the cells collected during this experiment appear to fall along the neural development trajectory.  In order to remove overtly different cells, I subsetted out the "mesenchyme" and reclustered using the remaining cells [here](remove-mesenchyme.html).

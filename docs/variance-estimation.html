Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/bumans/Organoid_Stress_Pilot/tree/5d8afa5b0840cd65c8111901f4455b45b85abe82" target="_blank">5d8afa5</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Previously, I combined datasets across different replicates and treatment conditions. My first pass at partitioning variance across cell type classification, replicate, cell line, and treatment gave confusing answers: cell type accounted for lots of variation, all other meta-data accounted for very little, and residual variation was larger than anything. This doesn’t make much sense.</p>
<p>Yoav suggested this is not the right way to analyze the data. First, because cluster composition and membership are likely confounded with cell line and treatment, the analysis should be done on each cluster separately. Maybe the right way to start is to use large manually selected clusters.</p>
<p>Second, getting at a similar issue, Yoav suggested trying to ascertain whether the mean expression values in each cluster are stable with regards to cell number by jacknifing to generate the pseudobulk data.</p>
<p>Finally, Yoav suggested comparing these variancePartition results to the results obtained by PCA. If these are consistent, then PC2 should correspond to cluster and PC1 should correspond to…something else. Can compare to the experimental meta-data to try to figure out what that is. If PC2 is not Seurat cluster, then something doesn’t add up.</p>

<p>What do our PCs represent? If cell type assignment truly explains the second largest portion of variation, then presumably it should line up with PC2 in the data, and something else (what?) should correspond to PC1. Alternatively, if interpretable experimental factors correspond to low-numbered PCs, this lends credence to the idea that the variancePartition model being used is misspecified or doesn’t use the correct input.</p>

<h2>Effect of cluster size on variance estimates</h2>
<p>So, the variance partitioning does appear to skew further away from being explainable as we get to smaller and smaller clusters. Is this an effect of cluster size, or is it something about these clusters? I’ll address this in two ways: (1) subsample clusters from above down to the size of intermediate and smallest clusters and see whether the effect persists, and (2) use pseudobulk counts from even less aggressively clustered data.</p>

This is…maybe not quite right, but it’s a start. The ncells term is the number of cells contributing to the pseudobulk data. It’s a little weird that it should have such a large effect, given that we’ve already separated things out by cluster. Still, this leaves the vast majority of variance for each gene unexplained, and there aren’t many other input variables that differed among samples that can be used to explain this…</p>
